## Essential Ruby Libraries

Ruby is more than just a language, it is a whole ecosystem. The power of the language is greatly multiplied by the thousands of gems freely available from the public gem server, but there are also some amazing tools that come already bundled with Ruby.

In this course, you'll learn how to use the standard libraries that come bundled in with every installation of Ruby. Tuts+ instructor Jos√© Mota will teach you how to:

* manipulate YAML, CSV and JSON data
* apply delegation for better code reuse
* fetch content from the web using Net::HTTP and the URI library
* build  Rake tasks
* manage files

You'll be amazed how much can be accomplished using only the standard Ruby libraries! Each library will be taught with simple examples and exercises that you can adapt for your own programming problems.

#### 1.1 Introduction

Welcome to Essential Ruby Libraries! In this lesson I'll explain the power and importance of the Ruby Standard Library, and I'll explain what the course will cover.

#### 2.1 Minitest

Testing is essential to good development, and Minitest gets testing off to a great start. As part of Ruby's standard library, this testing framework provides awesome features and a smooth workflow. Learn the basic steps on how to use Minitest in this lesson.

#### 2.2 CSV

One of the many different approaches to storing data is in a flat file. CSV is a commonly-used plain-text format for tabular data, and Ruby knows how to handle it perfectly. In this lesson, watch as we test-drive our code to manipulate CSV data.

#### 2.3 YAML

Different in nature from CSV, YAML stores structured data that's often geared towards system configuration. Its syntax is easy to read, as you'll see in this lesson where we'll focus on loading settings for our app.

#### 2.4 JSON

The de facto standard in data portability across web applications and services, JSON has a concise yet powerful syntax for sharing data across platforms. In this lesson, learn about Ruby's JSON library and experiment with parsing and generating JSON structures.

#### 2.5 Structs

Rather than relying on a specific class with detailed instructions on its value and behavior, you are allowed to choose a more simplistic Ruby construct. You will learn about structs and how they can assist in quickly prototyping a dataset with no particular behavior to be defined.

#### 2.6 SimpleDelegator

Moving on from data operations, we'll look at behavior--specifically how Ruby provides libraries to allow flexible, inheritance-like composition and code reuse. We'll focus on a very simple exercise that demonstrates delegation.

#### 2.7 Forwardable

Forwardable is another behaviour-related library. As we'll see in this lesson, Forwardable is an alternative to SimpleDelegator, useful when we want to expose selected methods of one class in another.

#### 2.8 Net::HTTP

In this lesson you'll learn about how to send HTTP requests directly from Ruby. We'll look at how to consume JSON data from HTTP and then to parse it into Ruby objects.

#### 2.9 URI

When you type an address into the browser's location bar, you're actually typing a uniform resource identifier (a URI) with a specific format and meaning. In this lesson, you'll learn how to interact with the URI library in order to dissect the different components of a URI.

#### 2.10 Digest

In this lesson you'll learn about the Digest module. Digest supplies a number of hash functions--one-way functions that allow us to secure otherwise sensitive data that we want to protect from possible malicious users. For example, passwords should always be hashed and salted before being stored in a local system. Also, hashes are a great way to generate unique symbols for your application.

#### 2.11 FileUtils

If you're used to managing your file system in a UNIX or Linux system, you should find FileUtils familiar, as it closely mimics the POSIX file operations. In this lesson, you'll learn how use FileUtils to create a folder structure for a simple Ruby project.

#### 2.12 Rake

Rake is the staple build tool of any Ruby project. It aggregates a series of tasks specified in a Rakefile and executes them as needed. In this lesson, you will learn how to create tasks with Rake in order to package a Ruby application into a tarball.
