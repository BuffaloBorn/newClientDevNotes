### Errors encountered while setup up a server


#### Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'

If your file my.cnf (usually in the */etc/mysql/* folder) is correctly
configured with

```apache
socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
```
you can check if mysql is running with the following command:

```bash
$ mysqladmin -u root -p status```

try changing your permission to mysql folder. If you are working
locally, you can try:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/lib/mysql/```

that solved it for me

are you sure you installed mysql as well as mysql server..

-   For example to install mySql server I'll use yum or apt to install
    both mysql command line tool and the server:

```bash
yum -y install mysql mysql-server (or apt-get install mysql
mysql-server)
```
Enable the MySQL service:

```bash
$ /sbin/chkconfig mysqld on```

Start the MySQL server:
```bash
/sbin/service mysqld start```

afterwards set the MySQL root password:
```bash
mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password' (with the quotes)
```
I hope it helps.

**Re: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket
    '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2) \[SOLVED\]**

    1.  /etc/init.d/mysql stop.
    2.  mysqld\_safe --skip-grant-tables &
    3.  mysql -u root.
    4.  use mysql;  
    5.  update user set password=PASSWORD("NEW-ROOT-PASSWORD") where
    User='root';
    6.  flush privileges;
    7.  quit.

# Integration Research topics

Checkout how apache layout and hooks into rails
#### Remove Linux folder
```bash
rm -rf mydir```

#### Renaming an existing file
```bash
mv /home/user/oldname /home/user/newname (maybe \[-T\]) ```

#### Figure out what .rz stands for

The .rz extension files are compressed with the inflate algorithm. The
Marshal version number comes from ruby’s Marshal::MAJOR\_VERSION and
Marshal::MINOR\_VERSION constants. It is used to ensure compatibility.

For gem generate\_index --directory /path/to/repo, expose /path/to/repo
via your HTTP server configuration (not /path/to/repo/gems).

When done, it will generate a set of files like this:

gems/\*.gem \# .gem files you want to

\# index
specs.<version>.gz
\# specs index

latest\_specs.<version>.gz \# latest specs index

prerelease\_specs.<version>.gz \# prerelease specs index

quick/Marshal.<version>/<gemname>.gemspec.rz \# Marshal
quick index file

Serving Multiple Rails Apps under One Virtual Host with Phusion
Passenger

Two Rails apps, both of which needed to be hosted under a single domain
- one served from root, and the other from a directory. Here was an
ideal setup:

-   app1 deployed to /apps/app1/current at mydomain.com
-   app2 deployed to /apps/app2/current at mydomain.com/app2

This is easily accomplished with Passenger, but took some tinkering to
figure out. Here’s how two ended up with:

```bash
<VirtualHost \*:80>
    ServerName mydomain.com
    DocumentRoot "/apps/app1/current/public"
    RailsEnv production

 <Directory "/apps/app1/current/public">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks -MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
 </Directory>

  <Directory /apps/app1/current/public/app2>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks -MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </Directory>
            RackBaseURI /app2
</VirtualHost>```

Apache is now properly configured. All that remains is a little setup in
the apps themselves. Since the Apache config expects a Rack/Rails app at
/apps/app1/current/public/app2, you just need to create a symlink in
/apps/app1/current/public to app2:

```bash
ln -s /apps/app2/current/public app2```

Depending upon your deployment strategy, you may need to create the
symlink each time you deploy. I setup a symlink as part of the
capistrano deploy and everything just worked™.

**Bonus**: If you use a common datastore and session\_store key within
your Rails applications, you can share authentication between the two
apps to create a cohesive “logged-in” interface.

Deploy an app to a sub-URI or subdirectory

You can also deploy an app to a sub-URI instead of the root URI. For
example, suppose that you already have a virtual host for the
application /websites/phusion:

```bash
<VirtualHost \*:80>
    ServerName www.phusion.nl
    DocumentRoot /websites/phusion/public
    <Directory /websites/phusion>
        Allow from all
        Options -MultiViews
        # Uncomment this if you're on Apache >= 2.4:
        #Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>```

And you want your application, located in /websites/secondapp, to be
accessible from the URL http://www.phusion.nl/subpath. To do this, you
need to perform the following:

-   Set Alias {SUBURI} {PATH TO YOUR APPLICATION'S PUBLIC DIRECTORY}.
-   Create a <Location /{SUBURI}> block.
-   Inside the Location block, set PassengerBaseURI /{SUBURI}.
-   Inside the Location block, set PassengerAppRoot {PATH TO YOUR
    APPLICATION ROOT}.
-   Create a <Directory {PATH TO YOUR APPLICATION PUBLIC
    SUBDIRECTORY}> block.
-   Inside the Directory block, set Allow from all, and (if you’re on
    Apache >= 2.4) Require all granted.
-   Inside the Directory block, disable MultiViews.

Here is an example:

```apache
<VirtualHost \*:80>
    ServerName www.phusion.nl
    DocumentRoot /websites/phusion/public

    <Directory /websites/phusion>
        Allow from all
        Options -MultiViews
        # Uncomment this if you're on Apache >= 2.4:
        #Require all granted
    </Directory>

    # These have been added:
    Alias /subapp /websites/secondapp/public

    <Location /subapp>
        PassengerBaseURI /subapp
        PassengerAppRoot /websites/secondapp
    </Location>

    <Directory /websites/secondapp/public>
        Allow from all
        Options -MultiViews
        # Uncomment this if you're on Apache >= 2.4:
        # Require all granted
        </Directory>
</VirtualHost>```

When you are done, restart Apache:

```bash
sudo apachectl restart```

(Depending on your operating system, the right command may be apache2ctl
instead of apachectl.)

You are now done. If you run into any problems, please refer to the

## Installing ruby javascript/css frameworks gems in client environment      

### Installing Bootstrap to a rails application via bootstrap-sass and autoprefixer-rails gem
1. place the above gem name in the GEMfile
2. call bundle install
3. add the following to app/assests/stylesheet/application.css.sass; you may have to use the folllowing commands to create .sass file
    ```bash
    $ mov app/assests/stylesheet/application.css app/assests/stylesheet/application.css.sass
    $ echo @import "bootstrap-sprockets" >> app/assests/stylesheet/application.css.sass
    $ echo @import "bootstrap" >> app/assests/stylesheet/application.css.sass```
4. import bootstrap javascript assets to app/assets/javascripts/application.js; text provided below
    //= require bootstrap-sprockets

    The file should have the following entries:
         //= require jquery
         //= require jquery_ujs
         //= require tubrolinks
         //= require bootstrap-sprockets

### Issues that occured after installing above gems

#### current ExexJS runtime doesn't support ES5, Please install Node.js

Here some code that I've used to pin point the issue, I've tried to change the JS runtime to Node.JS

```ruby
>> require 'execjs'
>> puts ExecJS.runtime.name
>> ExecJS.runtime = ExecJS::Runtime::Node
```

After locating the error within all the installed gems, it was discovered the autoprefixer.gem was looking for a particalur javacript feature and raised an error when it could not found it. Solution was not to include the gem in the project; need to fix the code or it a updated version of the gem.  

```ruby
ExecJS.eval('typeOf(Array.prototype.map)')!= function
